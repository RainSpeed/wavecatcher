https://www.anfractuosity.com/projects/wavecatcher/ - please see this website for more detail on the project.

The project will be used for acoustic cryptanalysis - "Acoustic cryptanalysis is a type of side channel attack that exploits sounds emitted by computers or other devices".

A number of aspects of computers emit ultrasound including SMPSs to inductors and capacitors present on the computer's motherboard itself.

You will likely require Kicad 5 to use the schematic/pcb layouts.

## Software

The software is now capable of extracting audio from the PDM microphone enabling playing of the audio with SoX.

I now need to swap the simple summing PDM to PCM converter, to enable better fidelity audio.
